# image_accessing_opencv
image accessing basics using open-cv.
1. Write a Python code that changes the colour value of the first 100X100 pixels of an image to black (0,0,0).

2. Write a program to combine two images side by side and display them using OpenCV.

3. Write an OpenCV code to load an image, extract a specific image region, and display both the original and extracted regions using Python.

4. Implement a Python script that reads an image and calculates and plots the histogram of its grayscale version. Save the histogram plot as an image file.

5. Create a program that reads an image and applies a Gaussian blur to it using the filter shown in the image below. Display both the original image and the blurred image. (To apply a filter, you have to convolve the filter with the image)
